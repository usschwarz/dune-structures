Examples illustrating the current capabilities of dune-structures

# implicitfiber

A 2D cantilever reinforced with 2 straight fibres. This is an example
from the Hansbo paper. The necessary app is *Structured 2D Cube Grid - Quadratic Elements*.

# robertcell

This is the example that we were cooking up in early 2020. A cube attaches
to the substrate in four corners and there are two curved fibers. The
necessary app is *Structured 3D Cube Grid - Linear Elements*.
Current status: Prestress not ported to current status.
